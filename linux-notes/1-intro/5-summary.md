# Summary
This chapter discussed the Linux system and the basics of how it works. The Linux kernel is the core of the system, controlling how memory, programs, and hardware all interact with one another. 

The GNU utilities are also an important piece in the Linux system. The
Linux shell, which is the main focus of this book, is part of the GNU core utilities. 
The chapter also discussed the final piece of a Linux system, the Linux desktop environment. Things have changed over the years, and Linux now supports several graphical desktop environments.
The chapter also discussed the various Linux distributions. A Linux distribution bundles the various parts of a Linux system into a simple package that you can easily install on your PC. The Linux distribution world consists of full-blown Linux distributions that include just about every application imaginable, as well as specialized Linux distributions that include applications focused only on a special function. The Linux LiveCD craze has
created another group of Linux distributions that allow you to easily test-drive Linux with out even having to install it on your hard drive.
