# The Linux Desktop Environment
## The X Window System
The X Window software is a low-level program that works directly with the video card and monitor in the PC, and it controls how Linux applications can present fancy windows and graphics on your computer.
When you first install a Linux distribution, it attempts to detect your video card and monitor, and then it creates an X Window configuration file that contains the required information.
Desktop environments are then installed on top of X to launch programs and manipulate files.

Desktop Environments: KDE, GNOME, Cinnamon, XFCE, Unity.
