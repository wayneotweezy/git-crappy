# Basics
## Starting the Shell
The GNU *bash* shell is a program that provides interactive access to the Linux system. It runs as a regular program and is normally started whenever a user logs in to a terminal. The shell that the system starts depends on your user ID configuration.
The */etc/passwd* file contains a list of all the system user accounts, along with some basic configuration information about each user. Here’s a sample entry from a /etc/passwd file:

christine:x:501:501:Christine Bresnahan:/home/christine:/bin/bash

Each entry has seven data fields, with fields separated by colons. The system uses the data in these fields to assign specific features for the user.
In this entry, Christine's default shell program is bash

## Using the Shell Prompt
The shell CLI prompt is your gateway to the shell. This is where you enter shell commands.

## The bash Manual
command: man e.g man konsole
When you use the *man* command to view a command’s manual pages, they are displayed with something called a *pager*. A pager is a utility that allows you to page through displayed text. Thus, you can page through the man pages by pressing the spacebar, or you can go line by line using the Enter key. In addition, you can use the arrow keys to scroll forward and backward through the man page text (assuming that your terminal emulation package supports the arrow key functions).

(Acquaint myself with man pages.)

*man 1 COMMAND* - system
*man 7* - overviews
man 5 - 	filetypes

*man (1 to 7) intro* introduces section content areas for sections 1 to 7 in depth. (visit them in my free time.)
