# Basics
## Starting the Shell
The GNU bash shell is a program that provides interactive access to the Linux system. It runs as a regular program and is normally started whenever a user logs in to a terminal. The shell that the system starts depends on your user ID configuration.
The /etc/passwd fi le contains a list of all the system user accounts, along with some basic con-
fi guration information about each user. Here’s a sample entry from a /etc/passwd file:

christine:x:501:501:Christine Bresnahan:/home/christine:/bin/bash

Each entry has seven data fields, with fields separated by colons. The system uses the data in these
fi elds to assign specific features for the user.
In this entry, Christine's default shell program is bash

## Using the Shell Prompt
the shell CLI prompt. The prompt is your gateway to the shell. This is the place
where you enter shell commands.

## The bash Manual
command: man e.g man konsole
When you use the man command to view a command’s manual pages, they are displayed
with something called a pager. A pager is a utility that allows you to page through
displayed text. Thus, you can page through the man pages by pressing the spacebar, or you
can go line by line using the Enter key. In addition, you can use the arrow keys to scroll
forward and backward through the man page text (assuming that your terminal emulation
package supports the arrow key functions).

(Acquaint myself with man pages.)
